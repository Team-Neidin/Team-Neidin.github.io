We have some exciting news to share, Team Neidín has an exciting new sponsor: KPH Construction. After some initial engagements, they were more than happy to help with the development of the team. As a local business in Kenmare, we are delighted to see that they are willing to support local community projects! They have also become the title sponsor of the team, and as such, the team will now be known as Team KPH Constructing Racing from this point forward. 

## New Logo

Following the establishment of a title sponsor, the formation of a new logo design was needed. The logo would come to represent the ideas of our team, and what we hope to achieve.

The bridge represents our locality, but it is also a symbol of unity as we hope to bridge the scientific literacy gap between rural and urban Ireland. The tree represents our sponsor, Holbein Carpentry & Joinery, and the growth we made in the last few months. The crane represents MHL Consulting Engineers and the better and improved Formula One car that we built. All of these aspects contribute to a distinct, and memorable representation of our team and our goals.
