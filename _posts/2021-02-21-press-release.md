## Introduction

F1 in Schools is an international STEM competition for school children, in which groups of 3–6 students have to design and manufacture a miniature car out of the official F1 Model Block using CAD/CAM design tools. Our team has qualified for the national final, which is due to take place on the week of the 19th of April, 2021.

## Purpose

The goal of the F1 in Schools competition is to build and race the fastest Formula One car, powered by compressed gas cylinders. For the competition, we need to raise sponsorship to fund the development of the car, manage the team's brand and partnerships, appropriately test and prototype car designs under consideration, and then analyse the performance of these designs. The team will be judged across multiple categories in the competition. These categories include racing, portfolios (there is two portfolios: one for engineering and one for enterprise), verbal presentation, pit display, and the team’s social media and marketing plan.

## Team Structure

Our team is led by Conor Casey, who takes responsibility for the management of the team, defines team goals, objectives and aims, ensuring the cars is adequately prepared for the competition and defines a timeline that the team followed to ensure everything is ready for competition day. Emmet Glynn Johnston is the team's Design and Manufacturing Engineer, and he oversees the creation, design, styling, and performance of the car. He also advises the wider team concerning the manufacturing requirements of the car. As mentioned previously, I am the Marketing Manager, and I am responsible for creating any necessary marketing materials required for the promotion of the team and undertake any related public relations tasks which align with the goals of the team.

## Sponsors

We currently have three sponsors providing support to our team: our main sponsor, KPH Construction, and two secondary sponsors, Holbein Carpentry & Joinery, and MHL Consulting Engineers. These sponsors have generously contributed to the team that has allowed us to take part in this competition

## Objective, aims and aspirations

Through raising public awareness of the team's progress, we hope to promote STEM subjects in rural communities in Ireland. STEM subjects are crucial in the modern world in which we live. They permeate all parts of rural life, and promoting these subjects; will support innovation in rural Ireland, which is suffering from a brain drain to large urban areas.

Agriculture is a major part of Ireland's culture, and targeting these communities; will help advance and further develop the agricultural community in these areas. We think supporting these communities will be beneficial as they are often overlooked by the nation.
