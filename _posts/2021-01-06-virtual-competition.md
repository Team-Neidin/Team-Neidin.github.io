Happy New Year! We hope you all enjoyed the festive break, and we wish you every success in 2021. Again, we would like to congratulate you on your qualification to the F1 in Schools Regional Finals. This is an important update on the F1 in Schools competition for 2020/21 - please share it with your team members ASAP.

As you will be aware, the public health situation in Ireland has rapidly changed over the past number of weeks. This will significantly impact your school experience, and as a result, your F1 in Schools experience also. Our first thoughts are to wish all of you safety and good health at this challenging time, and to advise you all to follow public health guidance at all times as you continue to progress your F1 in Schools journey. Secondly, we must inform you of significant changes to the F1 in Schools Ireland calendar for 2020/21. While there is still a considerable amount of the program of events to be finalised, we want to quickly clarify the updated plan for the F1 in Schools season.

## F1 in Schools Ireland National Final 2020

Given the current public health situation, it is now not feasible to stage in-person events for the remainder of the season. In light of this fact, we are committed to delivering the most exciting, engaging and immersive virtual experience possible for teams. As a result, we are pleased to inform you that this year, the 97 qualified teams will participate in a massive F1 in Schools Virtual National Final event. The F1 in Schools Ireland National Final for 2021 will be the largest F1 in Schools event ever, with more students, more races and more awards than any previous F1 in Schools event worldwide. The finals will take place over a number of days in the week of April 19th-23rd, culminating in an awards ceremony on Friday the 23rd of April, where the National Champions will be crowned. The full program of events is currently TBC, but will be communicated to you in full by March 1st.

As an F1 in Schools National Finalist, your team is now only one step away from winning a place at the F1 in Schools World Finals. In addition to the National Champions, the Overall 2nd and 3rd Placed teams will travel to the World Finals as part of Team Ireland. In addition, one further team will be invited to form an International Collaboration team with a team from another country. Alongside places at the World Finals, your team will participate in a massive 97-team knockout cup racing tournament, and be in with a chance of winning â‚¬5,000 in prize funding, with many additional awards to be announced between now and April.

Similar to last year's Virtual National Final (VNF), judging will take place remotely, but the judging criteria will remain the same. Teams will be expected to submit PDF copies of both their Engineering and Enterprise portfolios as planned, and will participate in Engineering and Enterprise interviews by video conference. Similarly, the Verbal Presentation will also be delivered by video conference. Racing will be completed remotely by the F1 in Schools Ireland team, similar to last year. Each team will be required to post their fully assembled car to F1 in Schools Ireland, and we will complete the racing at a remote location. Racing will still include both time trial and knockout cup racing. The racing elements will be live streamed. Finally, we are aware that some teams have invested in developing their pit displays. We are currently working on a method of allowing teams to showcase their pit displays virtually. This element of the competition is yet to be confirmed, but will be communicated as soon as possible. Judging is currently scheduled to take place during the week of April 19th-23rd, but you may be required to participate in judging sessions in the week of April 12th-16th to facilitate judging requirements.

While we regret having to cancel the F1 in Schools Regional Finals, we feel that by concentrating our resources on delivering a single large event, we can deliver a truly memorable and engaging experience. As a result, we are committing significant resources towards creating an online platform and media strategy to create a truly unforgettable experience. In that vein, we hope to have some exciting announcements to be made soon about the VNF.

## Manufacturing

In accordance with the changes above to the F1 in Schools calendar, we are now pushing back the deadline to submit CAD files for manufacturing of your car to the 5th of March. On this date, if you wish to have your car manufactured by F1 in Schools Ireland, you must submit your CAD files in .STL format via the website (link and submission process will be similar to 5 Page Plan). Again, this service is free of charge, and includes the CNC manufacture of a car body from the F1 in Schools Model Block, plus the manufacture of two full sets of 3D Printed components (wings, wheels etc). Teams can opt-out of this service if you wish to manufacture your car elsewhere, however, the car body must still be manufactured using the official Model Block.

## Feedback

We are aware that for many teams, the Regional Finals act as great source of feedback to improve scores ahead of the National Final. We are keen to ensure this opportunity is not lost this year, particularly given the number of newcomer schools participating. As a result, we will hold a "Mock" Regional Final round at the end of February, where each team can submit their Engineering and Enterprise Portfolios and receive detailed scoring and feedback from our judging panel. In order to have your portfolios evaluated by the judging panel, they must be submitted in PDF form by the 26th of February. Each team will receive specific feedback, scores and their ranking relative to other teams. Participation in the Mock Regional Finals is optional.

## Completing Your F1 in Schools Project Remotely

We are committed to making it possible for each team to complete their project remotely for as long as required. As regards resources for completing the design of your car, there is free Autodesk Student Version software available via the link at www.f1inschools.ie/downloads. From there, you can download free copies of Autodesk Inventor (CAD) and Autodesk CFD Ultimate (virtual wind tunnel - CFD) to design and test your CAD models. If you are having issues accessing this software at home, please let us know immediately, and we will work with you to resolve them. We encourage teams to continue to meet regularly, and to make use of free tools such as Zoom/Teams, Slack and Google Docs to complete your verbal presentation and portfolios.

Summary

To recap, the key changes to the calendar are (all dates are subject to adjustment):

* F1 in Schools Ireland National Final: 19th to 23rd of April 2021
* Deadline for submission of cars by post: 5th of April 2021
* Deadline for submission of CAD files for F1 in Schools manufacturing of cars: 5th of March 2021
* F1 in Schools Regional Finals: cancelled for 2021
* Optional submission of portfolios for judging feedback: 26th of February 2021

Finally, we now congratulate you on your qualification to the F1 in Schools National Finals, and we welcome your questions and feedback.

Kindest Regards,
The F1 in Schools Ireland Team
