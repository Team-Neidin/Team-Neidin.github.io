We are delighted to announce the finalised schedule for the F1 in Schools Ireland National Final for 2020/21! The following has been a culmination of many months of hard work by the entire F1 in Schools Ireland team, and we hope you are as excited for the National Finals as we are.

## TG4 to Broadcast the F1 in Schools Ireland National Final

The F1 in Schools Ireland National Final will culminate in an hour-long broadcast on TG4 at 8.30PM on Sunday 23rd of May 2021. The broadcast will feature a documentary-style following of several F1 in Schools teams on their journey to compete in the finals, the highlights of the knockout cup racing action, and will finish with the premiere announcement of the F1 in Schools National Champions. TG4 and Adare Productions will be selecting teams to participate in the documentary element of the broadcast by an online casting process. The deadline to submit a short video for casting purposes will be the 22nd of March. Adare Productions will be sending a link to their online platform to each team by the end of this week.  

We are extremely excited to be hosting the first ever F1 in Schools event to receive its own hour-long broadcast on national television. For the first time, F1 in Schools (including your team and your competitors) will be broadcast to hundreds of thousands of homes. Despite not being able to gather in person this year, we hope you are as excited as we are to showcase your talent and hard work to the nation. 

In addition to broadcasting the highlights package on TG4, F1 in Schools Ireland will also be producing YouTube live streams in the days leading up to the finals event. These will be as follows:

* Thursday 20th May: Live Broadcast of All Time Trial Races
* Friday 21st May: Live Broadcast of All Knockout Cup Races (up to but not including Quarter Finals)
* Saturday 22nd May: Awards Ceremony Broadcast (except National Champions, Knockout Cup Winners, 2nd Place, 3rd Place)
* Sunday 23rd May: TG4/Adare Productions Broadcast of National Final Highlights, including Knockout Cup and Awards Announcement

## How will the National Final Work Remotely?

Because of the unique circumstances of the pandemic, we have had to adapt our F1 in Schools events. This year, as you all know, we are running a Virtual National Final. That means that your judging is completed via Zoom, your cars are submitted by post, and everything happens remotely. Here's a little detail on what that process will look like: Teams complete their Enterprise Portfolio, Engineering Portfolio, Marketing and Social Media Document, and Pit Display poster, and submit these online to the website at f1inschools.ie/submit. 

Teams also submit their cars by posting their fully ready-to-race car to F1 in Schools Ireland (address to be provided later).

Judges review the documents submitted, then host a 15 minute interview with teams via Zoom, before finalising the marks. Teams make their Verbal Presentations via Zoom to a panel of judges. The racing of cars is carried out remotely by F1 in Schools Ireland staff. We are currently working on a method to integrate reaction times. All of the racing will be made available to watch across the four days of broadcasting before the results are announced.

## Finalised Participation Schedule

We are glad to be able to now announce the finalised list of submission dates for the National Final. Each of your written/visual elements (namely your Enterprise Portfolio, Engineering Portfolio, Pit Display Poster, and Marketing and Social Media Document) will be submitted in advance of your judging interviews. Judges will review your documents before your interview, and ask questions about your portfolio, before finalising your marks for each category. The 15 minute interview is a chance to clarify what is written in your portfolio and give a deeper explanation of your work. Two separate interviews take place* one for Engineering, and one for Enterprise & Pit Display. You won't be required to submit your Verbal Presentation in advance. In addition to the judged elements of the competition, you will be asked to complete a 10 minute race interview, which will be broadcast on our live stream while your car is racing on track. 

Judging interviews and your Verbal Presentation will take place in the week of 19th-23rd of April. As per last year, you will be invited to book time slots for your two 15 minute interviews, your 25 minute Verbal Presentation slot, and your 10 minute race interview in the two weeks before judging begins. We use a Calendly system to arrange booking of time slots. Booking is done on a first come, first served basis. We will share details of how to book your judging slots closer to the time. The deadline to book your time slots for judging is the 14th of April. 

The full list of deadlines/submission dates is given below:

* Deadline to submit application to feature on TG4 show: 22nd March
* Deadline for Submission of Enterprise Portfolio, Engineering Portfolio, Pit Display Poster, and Marketing and Social Media Document via website: 12th April
* Deadline to book time slots for judging: 14th April 
* Deadline for Posting of Cars to F1 in Schools: 16th April (cars must have a post mark/tracking date of being sent on 16th April to be raced).
